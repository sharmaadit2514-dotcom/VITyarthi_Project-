Project title:
Online Shopping Mart

Overview of the project:
A menu-driven console application that simulates a simple online shopping mart where a user can browse products, add/remove items in a cart, view the cart, and generate a final bill.​
It focuses on core shopping-cart logic (cart management and billing) using Python basics and object-oriented programming.

Features:
View list of products with ID, name, and price.​

Add items to cart with specified quantity and remove items fully or partially.​

View cart contents with subtotals and total amount.​

Checkout with an itemized bill (receipt-style) printed in the console.​

Technologies/tools used:
Programming language: Python 3.​

Environment: Any Python-supported OS (Windows/Linux/macOS) and a terminal/command prompt.​

Optional: Code editor like VS Code / PyCharm / IDLE for writing and running the script.​

Steps to install & run the project:
Install Python 3 from the official website if not already installed.​

Create a folder (e.g., online_mart) and save the Python file (e.g., main.py) containing the program code.​

Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder using cd online_mart.​

Run the program with python main.py or python3 main.py depending on your system.​

Instructions for testing:
Test each menu option: show products, add to cart, remove from cart, view cart, and checkout.​

Try valid and invalid inputs: wrong menu numbers, non-numeric product IDs, zero/negative quantities, removing items not in cart.​

Verify calculations: check that subtotals and total in the cart and final bill are correct for different quantities and combinations of products
